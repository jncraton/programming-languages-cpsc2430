Type Systems
============

---

Chapters 7 & 8

---

Purpose
-------

1. Provide implicit context for operations
2. Limit the set of valid operations
3. Explicit types can make code easier to read
4. Types known at compile time can drive performance optimizations

A type system
-------------

1. A mechanism to define types
2. Set of rules for
    - Type equivalence
    - Type compatibility
    - Type inference

Constructs with Types
---------------------

- Anything with a value
    - Constants
    - Variables
    - Parameters
    - Literals

Type Checking
-------------

- The process of ensuring that language type rules are followed
- Violations are *type clashes*

Strong Typing
-------------

A language enforces valid types and operations

Static Typing
-------------

A language is strongly typed and rules are enforced at compile time

Example Languages
-----------------

- Javascript - weak/dynamic
- Python - strong/dynamic
- C - strong/static

Javascipt
---------

- Dynamically typed
- Weakly typed

---

```js
// None of these are runtime errors
"Six" * 6 // NaN
true * 6 // 6
[1,2] * 6 // NaN
(() => 0) * 6 // NaN
```

Python
------

- Dynamically typed
- Strongly typed

---

```python
# We don't need to declare types explicitly
name = "Prof Craton" # Name is a string
# We will get errors for invalid types
score = name + 1 # TypeError
```

C
-----

- Statically typed
- Strongly typed

```c
// This program will not compile
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int num = 2; // int type is required

  printf(num); // type error (needs format string)
}
```

Polymorphism
------------

- We can design code to work with different types
- This can be achieved in C++ using generics (templates)

---

```c++
#include <iostream>

template <typename Type>
Type get_min (Type a, Type b) { 
   return a < b ? a:b; 
}

int main () {
   std::cout << get_min(2, 1) << std::endl; 
   std::cout << get_min("hello", "world") << std::endl;
}
```

Orthogonality
-------------

- We want to design language features to be used in any combination and have the combinations make sense

Null
----

- We often want a way to specify something other than the regular return value
- e.g. popping from and empty stack, dividing by zero, etc
- *null* is one option, but it can be used differently in different contexts

Rust Option
-----------

> Type Option represents an optional value: every Option is either Some and contains a value, or None, and does not. Option types are very common in Rust code

[docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/)

---

```rust
fn divide(numerator: f64, denominator: f64) -> Option<f64> {
    if denominator == 0.0 {
        None
    } else {
        Some(numerator / denominator)
    }
}

fn main() {
  match divide(2.0, 1.0) {
      Some(x) => println!("Result: {}", x),
      None    => println!("Cannot divide by 0"),
  }
}
```
