Target Machine Architecture

Much of programming language design involves the interplay between what we'd like our language to be able to do, and what the underlying hardware is able to do.

CPU Pipelining

Pipeline stalls
---------------

- Cache misses - Data or intruction may not be immediately available
- Resource hazards - Two instructions may need the same functional unit
- Data hazards - An instruction may depend on a data value that hasn't yet been computed
- Control hazards - Branches may  depend on data that has not yet been computed

Hardware mitigations
--------------------

- Larger caches
- More functional units
- Out of order execution
- Branch prediction

Software mitigations
--------------------

- Instruction reording to minimize load delay.
