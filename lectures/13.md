Object-Oriented Programming
===========================

---

Chapter 10

---

Abstraction
-----------

- Allows us to hide complexity behind simpler interfaces

Data Abstraction
----------------

- Create complex data structures with simple interfaces to pass around (e.g. records, structs, dictionaries, etc)

Control Abstaction
------------------

- Create organized sections of executable code that execute in well-understood ways and can be reused

Classes
-------

- Allow programmers to define a group of related abstractions (objects)
- Programming techniques built around classes are considered object-oriented

Data Members
------------

- Provide data abstraction
- Hold data used by objects
- Also known as `fields` or `properties`

Subroutine Members
------------------

- Provide control abstraction
- Subroutines and functions that objects can run
- Also known as `methods`

Constructors
------------

- Called to instantiate class object

---

```python
class Asset():
  def __init__(self, value, appreciation=.05, maintenance=.02):
    self.value = value
    self.appreciation = appreciation
    self.maintenance = maintenance
```

`this` and `self`
-----------------

- Provide explicit reference to class instance

Why Classes?
------------

- We can define new abstractions as extensions or refinements of existing abstractions via inheretance

Liskov Substitution Principle
-----------------------------

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

Inheritance Example
-------------------

```python
class Asset:
  """
  Represents some asset and provides methods to operate on it

  >>> house = Asset(50000, appreciation=.03, maintenance=.02)
  >>> int(house.future_value(years=30))
  121363
  >>> int(house.change_in_value(years=30))
  71363
  >>> int(house.maintenance_cost(years=30))
  40568
  >>> int(house.tco(years=30))
  -30795
  """
  
  def __init__(self, value, appreciation=.05, maintenance=.02):
    self.value = value
    self.appreciation = appreciation
    self.maintenance = maintenance

  def future_value(self, years):
    return self.value * (1 + self.appreciation)**years

  def change_in_value(self, years):
    return self.future_value(years) - self.value

  def maintenance_cost(self, years):
    return self.value * (1 + self.maintenance)**years - self.value

  def operating_cost(self, years):
    return 0

  def tco(self, years):
    return -self.change_in_value(years) + self.maintenance_cost(years) + self.operating_cost(years)

class Vehicle(Asset):
  """
  Represents a vehicle of some type

  >>> car = Vehicle(16000, appreciation=-.2, maintenance=.1, mpg=22)
  >>> int(car.tco(years=5))
  27343
  >>> car = Vehicle(16000, appreciation=-.2, maintenance=.1, mpg=38)
  >>> int(car.tco(years=5))
  24472
  
  """
    
  def __init__(self, value=16000, appreciation=-.25, maintenance=.1, mpg=25):
    super().__init__(value, appreciation, maintenance)
    self.mpg = mpg

  def operating_cost(self, years, miles_per_year=10000, gas_price=3.0):
    return miles_per_year / self.mpg * gas_price * years
```
