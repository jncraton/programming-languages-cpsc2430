Binding
=======

---

Section 3.1

---

Names
-----

- A mnemonic character string used to represent something else
- Can refer to variables, constants, types, functions, etc
- Allow programmers to *abstract* complexity (e.g. memory addresses)

Abstraction
-----------

- Hiding details to create clearer interfaces

Control Abstractions
--------------------

- Hide complex executable code
- Functions, subroutines, and certain macros are examples

Data Abstractions
-----------------

- Hide data representation details behind simpler operations
- Examples are classes and structs

Binding Time
------------

- A binding is an association between two things
- Binding time refers to the point when the association is created

Possible Binding Times
----------------------

- Language design time
- Program writing time
- Compile time
- Link time
- Run time

Performance
-----------

- As a general rule, making decisions earlier will make final programs more efficient
- Earlier binding times generally improve efficiency

Compile/Link Time
-----------------

- Bindings are finalized as one of the last steps of the build process

Run Time
--------

- Bindings are not finalized by the time the program begins running
- Bindings may be altered at runtime

Static and Dynamic Binding
--------------------------

- Static - any binding determined before runtime
- Dynamic - any binding determined after runtime

Object Lifetime and Storage
===========================

---

Section 3.2

---

Key Events
----------

- Creation and destruction of objects
- Creation and destruction of bindings
- Deactivation and reactivation of bindings

Lifetime
--------

- The period between creation and destruction
- Object lifetime and binding lifetime may or may not coincide

References
----------

- Values passed by reference typically have a longer lifetime than their binding
- **Dangling references** can occur when a reference outlives the object it points to

Stogage Allocation Mechanisms
-----------------------------

- Static - Absolute addresses and exist throughout execution
- Stack - Allocated and deallocated in LIFO order with matching function calls
- Heap - Allocated and deallocated at arbitrary times

Static Allocation
-----------------

- Global variables
- Machine code
- Variables declared `static`
- Can be used for local variables in certain languages (e.g. early Fortran without recursion)

Stack Allocation
----------------

- Must be used for local variables to support recursion
- Function instances get their own stack frame for local variables and other data

Calling Sequence
----------------

- Prolog - Executed initially to prepare the stack
- Epilog - Executed to put state back as it was before the call

Accessing Stack Variables
-------------------------

- Addresses are not known at compile time
- A *frame pointer* is created to point to the current stack frame
- Local variable references are offsets to this pointer

Heap Allocation
---------------

- Required for dynamically allocated data structures
    - Linked data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs, etc)
    - Objects of arbitrary size (documents, images, etc)
- Heap management is a complex topic

Language Differences
--------------------

- Allocation is always explicit
- Deallocation is explicit in some language (C,Rust,etc)
- Some languages specify that deallocation should happen automatically at runtime using *garbage collection*

Garbage Collection
------------------

- Automatically cleans up objects in memory when they are no longer needed
- Prevents many common classes of memory bugs
- Will have some runtime performance cost

Issues Mitigated by Garbage Collection
--------------------------------------

- Use after free (dangling references)
- Memory leaks
- Hard to debug as the problem does not trigger an exception at the root cause, but causes problems later

Heap Allocation in C
--------------------

- `malloc` returns a pointer to allocated heap memory
- `free` frees the memory

Example
-------

```c
char* ptr;

// Allocate 100 bytes
ptr = (char*) malloc(100 * sizeof(char));

// Do some things using the memory
// ...

// Free the memory
free(ptr);
```
