Declarative Languages
=====================

Declarative Programming
-----------------------

We express the logic of our program with out specifying its control flow

---

Declarative - Focuses on the what
Imperative - Focuses on the how

Examples
--------

- Logic langauges
- Purely functional languages
- Query langauges
- Domain specific languages

---

Logic languages are covered in detail in Chapter 12

---

Make
----

- The language that you've used to create makefiles is declarative
- You aren't telling make what to do to build your program
- You are providing a list of targets and their dependencies, and make determines how to resolve the dependencies

Query Lanugages
---------------

- You've likely already encountered SQL
- This languages allows us to frame requests for data in terms of the data we want, not how it will be retrieved

---

```python
users = [(1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob')]
messages = [(1, 'Hey'), (2, 'Hi'), (1, 'Bye')]

for (msguser, text) in messages:
  for (userid, name) in users:
    if userid == msguser:
      print(f"{name}: {text}")
```

---

```sql
create table users (
  userid integer primary key,
  name text
);
insert into users values (1,'Alice'), (2,'Bob');

create table messages (
  userid integer,
  content text
);
insert into messages values (1,'Hey'), (2,'Hi'), (1, 'Bye');

select name, content from messages natural join users;
```

Hardware Description Languages
------------------------------

Language used to describe the behavior of electronic circuits.
