Personal System Use
-------------------

You are welcome to use your personal system for any assignments, but I will not help with setting up environments beyond pointing you to official documentation.

Lovelace
--------

- Many programming languages and utilities are pre-installed
- If there are common tools that you'd like installed for everyone, let me know
- PRs for packages can also be submitted to [this file](https://github.com/jncraton/ubuntu-server-student-env/blob/master/envsetup)

Connection Details
------------------

- 10.73.56.26 (ssh)
- Initial passwords are "Password1"

Notes
-----

- The server should be stable, but I'm not running any backups and the server will be wiped at the end of the term.
- Your files in your home directory *should* be private, but please don't try to break into other students work.
