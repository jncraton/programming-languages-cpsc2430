Lexing
======

Definition
----------

> In computer science, lexical analysis, lexing or tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens 

Tokens
------

Commonly stored as (name, value) tuples. Example:

```python
my_variable = 17
```

Becomes:

```
(identifier, "my_variable")
(operator, "=")
(integer, 17)
```

Calculator Example
------------------

Reverse Polish Notation
-----------------------

- Operands follow their arguments
- e.g. "1 2 +" would produce 3

Supported operations
--------------------

- `1 2 +` = 3
- `4 2 -` = 2
- `2 3 *` = 6
- `8 4 /` = 2

Goal
----

- Scan a string such as "1 2 + 3 *" and create a list of (type, value) tuples:

```python
(number, 1)
(number, 2)
(operator, +)
(number, 3)
(operator, *)
```
