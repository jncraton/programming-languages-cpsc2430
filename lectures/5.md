Parsing
=======

---

> Parsing or syntax analysis is the process of analyzing a string of symbols conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.

Calculator Example

Supported operations
--------------------

- `1 + 2`
- `4 - 2`
- `2 * 3`
- `8 / 4`

Goal
----

- Scan a string such as "1 + 2 * 3" and determine if it is a valid operation, and order it so it can be executed.

- VP -> Adj Verb
- VP -> Verb

Big Idea
--------

- Grammar rules are applied recursively to generate members of the language.
- Grammar rules can be applied in reverse to parse a string to determine language membership.
- The parsing process can result in a parse tree showing token structure.

Calculator Grammar
------------------

There is just one rule:

- number -> number operator number

This rule can generate all strings that are a member of the language.

Tokens
------

Note that we are currently operating on tokens. We would need additional rules to operate directly on strings, but the lexer has already taken care of ensuring that we only have valid tokens.
