Parsing
=======

---

> Parsing or syntax analysis is the process of analyzing a string of symbols conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.

Calculator Example
------------------

Supported operations
--------------------

- `1 + 2`
- `4 - 2`
- `2 * 3`
- `8 / 4`

Goal
----

- Scan a string such as "1 + 2 * 3" and determine if it is a valid operation, and order it so it can be executed.

Chomsky Hierarchy
-----------------

Grammar       Automaton (Computer)
------------- ----------------------
Unrestricted  Turing Machines
Context Free  Pushdown Automata
Regular       Finite State Automata

Context-free Languages
----------------------

Big Idea
--------

- Grammar rules are applied recursively to generate members of the language.
- Grammar rules can be applied in reverse to parse a string to determine language membership.
- The parsing process can result in a parse tree showing token structure.

English Example
---------------

- S -> NP VP
- NP -> Adj Noun
- NP -> Noun
- VP -> Verb Adv
- VP -> Verb

Top-down parsing
----------------

- Begins with overall structure (sometimes guessed or assumed) and then determines details
- Top-down refers to order in which nodes in the final parse tree are determined

Bottom-up parsing
-----------------

- Determines low-level details first then builds our surrounding structure.

Shift-reduce parsing
--------------------

- Bottom-up
- Shifts tokens onto a stack
- Reduces them when they match against a rule

LR Parsing
----------

- Shift-reduce, bottom-up parse
- Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation first
- Deterministic algoritm
- Linear time performance

Calculator Grammar
------------------

There is just one rule:

- number -> number operator number

This rule can generate all strings that are a member of the language.

Tokens
------

Note that we are currently operating on tokens. We would need additional rules to operate directly on strings, but the lexer has already taken care of ensuring that we only have valid tokens.
