Functional Languages
====================

---

- First-class functions and higher order functions
- Extensive Polymorphism
- List types and operations
- Garbage Collection

---

In modern languages, the lines between language families and often have a lot of overlap.

First-class Functions
---------------------

- Functions can be passed as values

Higher Order Functions
----------------------

Functions that accept functions as parameters

---

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log('1 second has passed'), 1000)
```

Each
----

- Executes a function on each item in a list
- Returns nothing

---

```js
[1,2,3].forEach((i) => console.log(i))
```

---

```js
for (i of [1,2,3]) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Map
---

- Executes a function on each item in a list
- Returns a new list of the results

---

```js
// Square a list
[1,2,3].map((i) => i*i)
```

Filter
------

- Executes a function on each item in a list
- Returns a new list containing only items where the function evaluated to true

---

```js
// Remove negative numbers
[-1,0,1,2].filter((i) => i >= 0)
```

Every
-----

- Executes a function on every item in a list
- Returns true if the function always evaluates to true

---

```js
// Confirm that all values are positive
[1,2,3].every((i) => i > 0)
```

Reduce
------

- Executes a function on each item in a list and accumulates a single value
- Returns the final accumulated value

---

```js
// Sum values in a list
[1,2,3].reduce((i, a) => i + a, 0)
```

Purity
------

- A function is said to be "pure" if it has no side effects
- Side effects may inlcude changing global state or performing I/O
- Benefits include consistency and testability

---

```python
# A pure function
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Memoization
-----------

- We can sometimes optimize the performance of pure functions by caching their outputs

---

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# By caching results, we can improve the performance of our algorithm
@lru_cache()
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

History
-------

Lambda Calculus
---------------

- Formal mathematical basis for computation introduced by Alonozo Church
- Provably equivalent to a Turing Machine (see Church-Turing thesis)
- Not a programming language, but provides framework for computation and functional programming

Lisp
----

- First functional langauge (1958)
- Designed by John McCarthy and implemented by others (Steve Russell created the first working interpreter)
- Lisp is still used today in various forms (Scheme, Common Lisp, Clojure, etc)
- Lisp influenced many other modern languages (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc)

Miranda and Haskell
-------------------

- Emerged in the 80s as modern functional languages
- Haskell is open and used for functional programming research

Python
------

- Emerged in 1991 and was heavily influenced by Haskell
- Multi-paradigm language incorporating ideas from various programming languages

JavaScript
----------

- Created in 1995
- Brendan Eich was hired by Mozilla to implement Scheme for use in web pages
- This project quickly shifted to the creation of Javascript
- Glue language with Java syntax
- Includes first-class functions and closures

JS Example
