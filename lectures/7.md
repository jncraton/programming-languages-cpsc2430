Scope and Closures
==================

Scope
-----

(Section 3.3)

The textual region of a program where a binding is active

Scope
-----

Can also be used to refer to a region of a program where no bindings are changing

- Blocks e.g. { ... }
- Functions
- Modules

Referencing Environment
-----------------------

The set of active bindings

Inspecting the Referencing Environment
--------------------------------------

---

```python
import inspect

def main():
  a = 1

  def sub(b):
    c = 3
    print('Locals:', inspect.currentframe().f_locals)
    print('Parent:', inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_locals)

  sub(2)

main()
```

```
Locals: {'c': 3, 'b': 2}
Parent: {'sub': <function main.<locals>.sub at 0x7f89903ce268>, 'a': 1}
```

Static (Lexical) Scope
----------------------

Binding can be determined at compile time

Early Basic
-----------

- Global-only scope
- No variable declarations
- Variable names could be only 2 characters (letter + digit)

---

```basic
10 FOR X = 1 TO 10
20 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD"
30 NEXT X
```

Fortran 77
----------

- Global and subroutine scope
- Subroutines can't be nested
- Variable declarations are optional (assumed to be `integer` if name begins with I-N or `real` otherwise)

static variables
----------------

- Local variable with lifetime covering entire program execution
- aka `save` in Fortran, `own` in Algol

---

```c
/* `static` example in C */

#include <stdio.h>

void count() {
  int value = 0; // Try with `static`
  printf("%d\n", value++);
}

int main(void) {
  for (int i = 0; i<10; i++) { count(); }
}
```

---

Nested Subroutines
------------------

- Introduced in Algol 60
- Allow scopes to nest

Closest Nested Scope Rule
-------------------------

- A name is known in it's scope and nested scopes
- Unless it is hidden by another name in a nested scope

---

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char* level = "Grandparent";
  {
    printf("%s\n", level);
    {
      char* level = "Local";

      printf("%s\n", level);
    }
  }
}
```

Built-ins
---------

- Many languages define built-ins at an outermost scope level
- These can be overwritten in certain languages

---

```python
# Don't do this...
def len(str):
  return 42

print(len("Hello, World"))
```

Declaration Order
-----------------

- Some languages require the definition exist prior to it being accessed in a block
- Some languages require all definitions to be present at the start of the block

---

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("%d\n", i); // Error

  int i;
}
```

Dynamic Scoping
---------------

- Scope is not known until runtime
- Generally a bad idea
- Expensive, not used in most modern languages

---

```python
n : int # Global Declaration

def first():
  n = 1

def second()
  n : int # Local Declaration
  first()

n = 2

if read_int() > 0:
  second()
else:
  first()
print(n)
```

Overloading
-----------

Some names can refer to multiple objects at a given time

---

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("%f\n", (float)(5/2));
  printf("%f\n", (float)(5/2.0));
}
```

Polymorphism
------------

Allows a subroutine to perform differently based on the types involved

---

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

void print(int val) {
  printf("%d\n", val);
}

void print(char* val) {
  printf("%s\n", val);
}

int main() {
  print((char*)"Hello, world!");
  print((int)10);
}
```

Modules
-------

- Provide a way to bundle object such as subroutines, variables, and classes together
- May not be available unless explicitly exported from on module and imported into another
