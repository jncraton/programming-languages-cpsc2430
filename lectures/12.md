Object-Oriented Programming
===========================

---

Chapter 10

---

Abstraction
-----------

- Allows us to hide complexity behind simpler interfaces

Data Abstraction
----------------

- Create complex data structures with simple interfaces to pass around (e.g. records, structs, dictionaries, etc)

Control Abstaction
------------------

- Create organized sections of executable code that execute in well-understood ways and can be reused

Classes
-------

- Allow programmers to define a group of related abstractions (objects)
- Programming techniques built around classes are considered object-oriented

Data Members
------------

- Provide data abstraction
- Hold data used by objects
- Also known as `fields` or `properties`

Subroutine Members
------------------

- Provide control abstraction
- Subroutines and functions that objects can run
- Also known as `methods`

Why Classes?
------------

- We can define new abstractions as extensions or refinements of existing abstractions via inheretance

Liskov Substitution Principle
-----------------------------

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
